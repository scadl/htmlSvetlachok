# htmlSvetlachok
This is one of my oldest projects. It was made in early 2009, when flash technology was it's blossom in our regional internet segment. At that moment I learned how to build light, but pretty looking site combining HTML, CSS and Flash animation. 

This partuclar project is dedicated to orthodox child magazine "Svetalschok" (Firefly), printed at that time in paper, but the publisher also wanted to have online version of it, with archive, editorials, and some materails which was not included to paper version. 

You can use this repository yo learn how to combine embeded animation and you html scaffold, especually, if you have prepeared graphical template, made by artist. On top of that, I added "_Flash" folder, which contains all *.FLA files, of SWFs used here, so you can learn how to make these animation and triggers inside falsh. (To open them you need Adobe Flash CS3 Professional)
